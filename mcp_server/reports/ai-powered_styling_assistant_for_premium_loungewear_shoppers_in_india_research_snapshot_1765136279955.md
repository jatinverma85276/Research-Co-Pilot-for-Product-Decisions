Action items

1. Conduct 20–30 customer discovery interviews with target segments in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi to validate needs and willingness to pay
2. Run keyword and paid-search experiments to quantify demand (CPC, search volumes) for core queries like "premium loungewear" and "loungewear set" over 3 months
3. Prototype a lightweight MVP: outfit recommendations + size/fabric guidance for a curated catalog of 50 SKUs from 2–3 premium brands
4. Partner with 1–2 premium DTC loungewear brands for an initial pilot (revenue share or affiliate model) and manage fulfillment/returns SLA
5. Build a small labelled dataset (images + fit/fabric attributes + returns reason) to train recommendation and fit models
6. Design a clear privacy and data-use policy and minimal-permission onboarding flow to reduce friction
7. Define pricing/test monetization: paid stylist tier, affiliate revenue, or subscription for curated boxes; run A/B tests
8. Prepare logistics and reverse-logistics plan to minimize return costs (try-at-home windows, prepaid returns)
9. Run a 3-month pilot in one metro with targeted social ads and influencer partnerships to refine CAC and LTV assumptions
10. Measure key metrics (AOV, conversion lift from recommendations, return rate, CAC, NPS) and iterate on product and brand positioning
